## Project Brief
  
Using the above description, help me write a markdown editor as described above. We want a modern looking gui interface. We will use python to develop the app. We can split across multiple python files if that is easier or better practice. The main objective is a simpler editor as shown above that I can learn from the implementation and build in extra functions as I required. Make sure the code is well commented so that I know what each section does.
